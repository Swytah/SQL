Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find all the projects, assignments, and notes I worked on during the MySQL Bootcamp, based on the [Complete MySQL Bootcamp]tutorial series. This course covered everything from the basics of MySQL to more advanced topics, and I've documented my learning journey here.

### What’s Inside
- **Projects**: Real-world examples and implementations of database design, queries, and more.
- **Assignments**: Practical tasks that helped me solidify my understanding.
- **Notes**: Detailed insights from the sessions—sort of like a personal study guide that captures both theory and hands-on examples.

- **Getting Started with MySQL**: Setting up the environment and running basic commands.
- **Core SQL Commands**: Writing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries.
- **Database Design**: How to create and organize databases and tables effectively.
- **Data Types**: Understanding the different types of data MySQL can handle.
